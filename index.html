                   <p>Everybody knows the current situation of Bangladesh. In the middle of 2022, Sylhet region of Bangladesh was hit by heavy floods. The floods, caused by upstream water and four days of torrential rains, are more severe than in the past 122 years. The floods were so severe that it cut off Sylhet, a district in eastern Bangladesh, from the rest of the country.<br>

                   Homes, educational institutions and offices were submerged in the catastrophic floods. As a result, the flood victims took shelter in safe shelters to survive. About 70 people were killed and more than a million people lost their homes in the flash floods.<br>
                    
                    Every year during the monsoon season, the vast northern part of the country, including Sylhet, is flooded. Experts believe that unplanned construction of dams in Haor and non-occupation or excavation of rivers have resulted in repeated floods in the Sylhet region. So to get relief from floods we have to refrain from building unplanned dams. Besides, people need to be made aware to avoid river occupation and other activities that are harmful to the environment.
